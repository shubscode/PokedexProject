# PokedexProject

The Pokedex allows users to get information on various Pokemon in the Pokemon world. Users can query for specific Pokemon through its name or number or get a list of random Pokemon through our featured Pokemon feature. They can also filter Pokemon based on type, minimum attack, minimum defense, and minimum hp. After searching, matching Pokemon are presented as either in a collection or a table and can be selected to view detailed stats of the Pokemon. Users can also add Pokemon to a list of their favorites pokemon and also web search for chosen Pokemon.
